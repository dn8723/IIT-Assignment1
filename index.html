										<h2>My Profile</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Personal Information</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Name: David Nguyen</li>
										<li>Email: s3816170@student.rmit.edu.au</li>
										<li>Nationality: Australian</li>
										<li>Ethnicity: Vietnamese</li>
										<li>Education: Bachelor of Information Technology - RMIT University (current)</li>
										<li>Languages spoken: English (first language), Vietnamese (intermediate proficiency)</li>
										<li>Interesting hobby: I started bike riding during the COVID-19 lockdowns in Melbourne, which has now developed into an off-road mountain biking hobby and a constant money pit as I'm always upgrading.</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
									<p>My initial interest into computers was around the time I was introduced to the game platform 'Steam', which was when I transitioned from console gaming to computer gaming. As a student I was limited on how much I could spend so I had to look into and find the best "bang for buck" parts within a budget. Through researching and the whole process of building my first PC, I familiarised myself with computer hardware and what each part's role was and how they interacted with one another, but at that point, it was just a hobby. It wasn't until later on when I came across the television series 'Mr Robot' that I developed a deeper interest in IT, and more specifically cyber security, and towards the end of my schooling when I started thinking about courses and careers, that I began to consider a profession in the IT field. I have yet to decide on a specific profession, but I have interests in cyber security, data science and UX/UI design. Currently, I have some basic experience in a few coding languages including Python, HTML, CSS and SQLite and web-based tools such as Figma, all of which I expect to build on as I progress through my course.</p>
									<p>I chose to study at RMIT due to its reputation for practical, industry-based learning as well as the abundant facilities and support that is available to students. I also had friends who were already students at RMIT who recommended it. The campus location also appealed to me for the social aspect of student life as it is right in the heart of the Melbourne CBD. </p>
									<p>During my studies at RMIT, I expect to not only learn about and develop hard skills such as coding/programming in various languages, computer hardware/software, networking, etc but also the soft skills including communication, working in a team and problem solving. I believe this would adequately prepare me for when I begin my career in IT.</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)</li>
										<li>In-depth understanding of different OS, hardware, software, networks and infrastructure</li>
										<li>Experience in scripting languages such as Python</li>
										<li>Knowledge of security tools (Firewalls, SIEM, packet capturing)</li>
										<li>Malware and threat hunting</li>
										<li>Teamworking skills</li>
										<li>Problem solving skills</li>
										<li>Effective communication</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Skills, Qualifications and Experience I have:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Currently completing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT</li>
										<li>Basic programming skills in languages including Python, HTML, SQLite</li>
										<li>Problem solving skills</li>
										<li>Teamwork skills</li>
									</ul>
									<p>To obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, I will build on my technical abilities such as programming, and soft skills such as teamwork and communication as I progress through and complete my Bachelor of IT. I would aim to take on an internship in my final years of my degree in order to get some real-world experience before graduating.  In order to obtain more in-depth knowledge of certain areas that are relevant to the position, I would pursue certifications such as CompTIA’s Network+, Security+.  Once I have built a solid foundation, I would then pursue more advanced certifications such as CySA+, CASP+, PenTest+, CISSP, etc as I progress in my career.  An example career path I would take could be: IT Support > Network/System Administrator > Cyber Security Support Analyst > Senior Cyber Security Analyst.</p>

										<h3>Overview</h3>
										<h4>What do these results mean to you?</h4>
										<p>By taking these tests, I can get a better understanding of how I think about and approach things. The test results indicate that I am more objective when making decisions, and approach things in a logical manner. I also get a better understanding of things by putting them into practice rather than just learning about it. There are also some traits that I feel that don’t describe me well. For example, I feel like I relate more to a ‘Turbulent’ nature rather than an ‘Assertive’ nature, as I tend to have worries such as if I can fit in new environments, or constantly having second thoughts about things.</p>
										<h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
										<p>This information would tell us a lot about how to work with each other in the team in a way that can make the most of everyone’s efforts and effectively leverage each other’s strengths and covering for each other’s weaknesses. For example, having a ‘Thinking’ trait over a ‘Feeling’ trait, I can tend to make decisions based more on rationality. This can be positive in the sense that I can make decisions that I think can be most effective or realistic for the task, based on the information presented to me. On the other hand, this trait can also be seen as negative because a lack of empathy or ‘Feeling’, could mean making these decisions without properly taking into consideration of how other members feel about it. This could cause rifts within the team and have a negative impact on the overall success of the project.</p>
										<h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
										<p>When forming a team, I should consider all the traits, strengths and weaknesses that are relevant to me and seek members that can complement them. This information can also give us an idea of how each member likes to work through their learning style, so teaming up with people with similar learning styles would ensure that members are on the same page and allow us to collaborate most effectively.</p>

									<h3>Project Idea</h3>
									<h4>Privacy mobile app</h4>
									<h4>Overview</h4>
									<p>The project will be to develop a mobile app (iOS and Android) that acts as a ‘one-stop shop’ for users to have more control over their privacy when using their devices. The app would allow users to easily carry out tasks for all their apps such as adjusting all their privacy settings and access permissions, managing adblockers, securely deleting any sensitive data, managing trackers such as where they’ve been or what they’ve been searching for online, etc. The app aims to simplify privacy for everyday users, of which a large number that are oblivious to how much and what kind of data is being collected when they are using the mobile apps on their smart phones.</p>
									<h4>Motivation</h4>
									<p>Smart phones have progressively become such a necessity in our daily lives. According to Statista, there are approximately 6.64 billion smart phone users in the world today, which means that about 83.72% of the world’s population owns a smart phone (Turner, 2022). With this number of users, you can imagine how much data users knowingly or unknowingly, are sending through their devices. How many times when you’ve downloaded an app, have you kept pressing ‘next’ or ‘I agree’ without actually properly reading the all the terms and policies in front of you? Many, if not the majority, simply agree and in doing so, agree to the default settings that the app sets which may not be appropriate for each individual user as everyone will have a different level of what they are comfortable sharing.</p>
									<h4>Description</h4>
									<p>This mobile app will be available on both iOS and Android platforms and will be a hub where users can manage the privacy settings of all the apps they have installed on their phone and also protect their data through security tools. The app will prompt users to create an account to be able to save their desired settings. Users will be able to add or remove the apps they want to manage on a menu where they can check the boxes. Here they will be able to manage their privacy settings and app access permissions. Tools available for users include adblockers to protect against potential malware or phishing attempts, and tracker protection to protect sensitive data from being collected. The app will be available for free as a basic version, and a paid version which will include access to a virtual private network (VPN) for secure web usage and location masking.</p>
									<h4>Skills  and Tools requried</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Programming skills: To develop a mobile app on iOS, I would need to know languages such as Swift and Objective-C. On the android platform, I would need Java and Kotlin. Other languages to consider include HTML5, C++, C#.</li>
										<li>UX/UI skills: In order to make the mobile app intuitive and easy to for users to use, I would have to have prototyping and wireframing skills to ensure that the flow of the app is clear and logical. Here I can use web-tools such as Figma to help design the layout and pages of the app.</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Outcome</h4>
									<p>Upon completion of the project, I hope that the app will assist in making privacy less tedious and more accessible for every day end users. The original problem will be solved by having all their privacy needs in one, easy to find place, where they can have control over all their apps, and are provided tools to use to protect their data. The overall impact I hope to achieve through this project is for people to have more control over the kind of information they are making available and in turn, prevent their information from possibly being used fraudulently.</p>
